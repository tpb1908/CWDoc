## Background


### Git

The Git version control system was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and  is designed for nonlinear distributed development, whereby multiple developers work on multiple different tasks concurrently.

Git is used to store snapshots of a project, and store them as unique versions.
Git makes it easy both to rollback changes to a previous state, and to merge the project with changes made to it elsewhere.

#### Storage

Git acts as a content-addressable filesystem.
When content is inserted into the system, the return value is a key which can later be used to retrieve the content.

The key returned is a 40 character (160 bit) SHA-1 checksum of the content and its header.
The probability of a collision occurring across n unique objects is 0.5 * n<sup>2</sup> /2<sup>160</sup>.
In order to achieve a 1% probability of collision 1.7x10<sup>23</sup> objects are required, which is effectively impossible.

In order to store a file system structure, Git uses tree objects.
Each node in the tree is constructed of four elements:

- The unix file permissions
- A pointer to either a blob or another tree
- The hash of the object pointed to
- The filename


#### Repositories

Each project is stored in a repository.
A repository contains a set of commit objects, and a set of references to commit objects, called heads.

#### Commits

A commit object contains:
- A set of files, describing the project state at the time of the commit
- References to parent commit objects
- An SHA1 checksum which uniquely identifies the commit object

#### Heads

A head is a reference to a commit object.
Each head has a name, with the default name being 'master'.
A repository can contain any number of heads, but at any one time there is only a single current head.

#### Branches

Every branch has a head and every head has a branch. The only difference between the two is that while a branch refers to a head and the entire history of ancestor commits preceding it, a head is used to refer to a single commit object, the most recent commit in a branch.

When the user switches branches their current head pointer is changed to point to the branches head, and all of their working files are rewritten to match those at that head commit.

#### Merging

When work has been completed on one branch, the changes need to be brought into another branch in order to allow others to use the changes.

This is done by the merge command. 
When asked to merge a branch 'changed' into a branch 'other' Git:
- Finds the common ancestor of 'changed' and 'other'
- If the ancestor commit is equal to the head of 'other'
    - Updates 'other' by adding the commits which have been made to 'changed' since the common ancestor
    - Updates the head pointer of 'other' to point to the same commit as 'changed'
- Otherwise a full merge must be performed. This involves:
    - Determining the changes made between the common ancestor and the head of 'changed'
    - Attempt to merge these changes into 'current'
    - If the merge was successful:
        - Create a new commit with two parents 'changed' and 'other'
        - Set 'other' and the working head to point to this commit
    - Otherwise
        - Insert conflict markers into the file
        - Inform the user of the problem without creating a commit


### GitHub

GitHub is hosting service for Git repositories, and the largest host of source code in the world. 

GitHub adds numerous features on top of the Git system.

#### Issues

Issues are a tracker system for ‘tasks, enhancements, and bugs’.
Each repository has its own Issues section. Within the issues section of a repository each issue has its own content. The screenshot below shows the issues section for a repository.

![Issues](http://imgur.com/wQieMo5.png)

The page is divided into two sections, open and closed.
An issue which is marked as open is one which has not yet been resolved and is either being investigated or to be investigated later.

When an issue is created, it must have a title explaining its purpose.
It is then assigned an automatically incremented number, and linked to the user who created the issue.

While the purpose of an issue may be clear from its title, larger projects are easier to manager when issues are separated into different categories.
This is achieved through labels. 
A label is a string of text and a background colour which may be applied to an issue, allowing it to be filtered.

Further, each issue may have up to 10 assignees.
An assignee is a user who has been designated to investigate an issue.
Filtering by assignees allows work to be more easily distributed, as well as identifying issues which are not yet under investigation.

In order to facilitate the investigation of an issue, each issue has a comments section.
The comments section consists of a mixed feed of comments and events as shown below

![Issue comments](http://imgur.com/06VkP61.png)

#### Pull requests

A pull request is effectively a subclass of issue.
A pull request is designed to notify users about changes which you have made to a repository.

As a pull request follows the issue model it has the same comments section as an issue.
The primary difference is that a pull request also references any number of commits which can be merged into the repository.

#### Projects

'Projects' were introduced in September 2016.
The aim of projects is to integrate the planning of a project and its features into the development process, as such projects are closely linked with the issue system.
Each repository may contain multiple projects, each of which could be used to plan a particular feature or release.

Each project has title and description, which are displayed in the projects section of a repository page.

![Projects](http://imgur.com/hGecHxh.png)

Since their release projects have been updated to include the same possible states as issues.

A project consists of multiple columns of content.
Each column has a title and can be reordered within the project.


![Project columns](http://imgur.com/9hn7pib.png)

Each item within a column is either a card, which is simply a string of markdown up to 250 characters in length, or a reference to an issue, which displays a link to the issue, its state, labels, and assignees.


#### Integrations

Integrations are designed to extend GitHub's functionality.
An integration can be installed to a users account or to a single repository, allowing it hook access.

When an integration has hook access, it is notified of changes to the repository, which might be a new commit being pushed to the repository or an issue being created.

An integration could be used to automatically tag issues based on keywords in their text.

A more common use of integrations is to notify a continuous integration system.
Continuous integration is a practice where checked in code is verified against an automated build system, allowing the developer to be notified of a problem without manually running tests.

Continuous integrations are often used as checks on pull requests. If a check fails the pull request will not be merged.


### Markdown

Markdown is a markup language with plain text syntax.

Markdown doesn't have a common standard, however there are some universal rules.

```
# Heading level 1

## Sub-heading

### Another deeper heading
 
Paragraphs are separated
by a blank line.

Two spaces at the end of a line leave a  
line break.

Text attributes _italic_, *italic*, __bold__, **bold**, `monospace`.

Horizontal rule:

---

Bullet list:

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Numbered list:

  1. item 1
  2. item 2
  3. item 3

A [link](http://example.com).
```

will be formatted as

# Heading level 1

## Sub-heading

### Another deeper heading
 
Paragraphs are separated
by a blank line.

Two spaces at the end of a line leave a  
line break.

Text attributes _italic_, *italic*, __bold__, **bold**, `monospace`.

Horizontal rule:

---

Bullet list:

  * item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

Numbered list:

  1. item 1
  2. item 2
  3. item 3

A [link](http://example.com).

#page

GitHub uses its own markdown structure with some extra features.

#### Lists

 Dashes can be used to create lists:

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

creates

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Nested lists are also supported

```
- Item 1
  - Item 1 depth 2
  - Item 2 depth 2
- Item 2 
```

creates

- Item 1
  - Item 1 depth 2
  - Item 2 depth 2
- Item 2 

#### Images

Images can be inserted inline


```
![Image description](image_url)
```

should load and display the image

further, 

```
![Image description](relative_path)
```

should attempt to load the image from the current repository.

#### Blockquotes

Blockquotes are displayed in the same way as a HTML blockquote tag

```
> Some quoted text
> across 
> multiple lines
```

> Some quoted text  
> across  
> multiple lines

#### Strikethroughs

Placing two tildes on either side of a sequence will draw a stirkethrough through it

```
~~text~~
```

will be displayed as

~~text~~

#### References

Issue references

A # followed by the number of an issue within the repository will be shown as a link to that issue

User references

An @ followed by a username will be shown as a link to that user


#### Emoji

Emoji names wrapped in colons are converted to emoji characters

```
:camel:
```

is displayed as the emoji character 🐫


#### Code 

Code can be inserted between triple backquotes 

```

 ``` Language

 Some code

 ```

```

Will display the code without applying any other formatting

``` C
float Q_rsqrt( float number )
{
	long i;
	float x2, y;
	const float threehalfs = 1.5F;

	x2 = number * 0.5F;
	y  = number;
	i  = * ( long * ) &y;                       // evil floating point bit level hacking
	i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck? 
	y  = * ( float * ) &i;
	y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 1st iteration
//	y  = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 2nd iteration, this can be removed

	return y;
}
```
#### HTML

The HTML tags which correspond to each of the markdown features can be used in place of the markdown characters.

There are also further tags which do not have a markdown equivalance:

The sup and sub tags display text as <sup>super</sup> and <sub>sub</sub> script respectively.

The font tag can be used to choose a text color and face

```<font color="red" face="impact">Formatted text</font>```

gives <font color="red" face="impact">Formatted text</font>

## Android Application Structure

### Activities

The Android developer documentation defines an ```Activity``` as ‘a single, focused thing that the user can do.’.
The ```Activity``` class is responsible for creating the window in which an application's UI is placed.

When an ```Activity``` is launched, the Android system first calls the ```onCreate``` method, in which the ```Activity``` should create its view tree (if applicable) and perform any setup that it needs to.
Next the ```onStart``` method is called, making the ```Activity``` visible to the user.
Finally, the system calls ```onResume``` when the ```Activity``` enters the foreground. In this state the user can interact with the Activity.

The ```Activity``` will stay in the resumed state until it exits it, or another ```Activity```

![Activity lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/images/activity_lifecycle.png)


### Intents

Activities are launched by Intents. 
An ```Intent``` is  ‘an abstract description of an operation to be performed’. ```Intent``` objects are used throughout the Android system to communicate both within apps, and between them.

Intents are messaging objects used to request an action from another application component, within the same app or a different one.

An example of a simple implicit Intent is to launch a messaging application to send a string of text.

```Java
// Create the text message with a string
final Intent sendIntent = new Intent();
sendIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "Our message");
sendIntent.setType("text/plain");

// Verify that there is an application to handle the Intent
if (sendIntent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager()) != null) {
    startActivity(sendIntent);
}
```

If the user has already chosen a default application for ```Intent.ACTION_SEND``` the Android system will launch the specified Activity, otherwise it will show a chooser dialog.


### Intent handling

In order for any ```Activity``` to be launched it must be declared in the application's manifest, with an item pointing to the ```Activity``` class.

``` XML
<activity android:name=".app.TestActivity" />
```

 Declaring the ```Activity``` in the manifest allows it to be launched, however to be launched from outside of the app the ```Activity``` must specify an Intent filter.
To specify that an```Activity``` is a ```MAIN``` ```Activity```, one which can function as an entry point for the app and does not require being launched with data, the ```MAIN``` intent filter must be registered.
Further, to be shown in the device’s app drawer, allowing the user to easily launch it, the ```Activity``` must register the ```LAUNCHER``` Intent in its Intent filter.

The simplest primary ```Activity```for an app has the following manifest registry:
``` XML
<activity
   android:name=".app.MainActivity">
   <intent-filter>
       <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
       <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
   </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

This allows the app to be launched from the user's home-screen.


### Layouts

Layouts in Android apps are usually defined in XML.

The base class for an Android View is the ```View``` class in the ```android.view``` package.
```View``` directly extends ```Object``` and contains many methods and interfaces for laying out and drawing a the ```View``` on screen.
All individual ```Views```, for example to input text or display an image, extend ```View```. 

However, layouts would be difficult to work with if it were only possible to manipulate individual ```Views```.
A ```ViewGroup``` is a subclass of ```View``` which can contain other ```Views```, called children.
The ```ViewGroup``` class is the base class for all layouts and ```View``` containers.

One of the most commonly used ```ViewGroups``` is ```LinearLayout``` which can align other ```Views``` in a linear fashion either horizontally or vertically. This would be useful for setting out multiple Views one after another on a device screen.
There are also more complicated ```ViewGroups``` such as ```RelativeLayout``` which aligns its children relative to each other and itself.

#### Layout inflation

While ```View``` objects can be, and are, created at run time, it is usually much quicker to write, and more easily understandable to define the layout in a layout resource file.

A layout resource file is an XML file containing the ```View``` classes to be shown on screen and their attributes.

A simple login ```Activity``` might have the following layout

``` XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
              android:orientation="vertical"
              android:layout_width="match_parent"
              android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <EditText
        android:id="@+id/user_name"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:ems="10"
        android:inputType="textPersonName"
        android:hint="Username"/>

    <EditText
        android:id="@+id/password"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:ems="10"
        android:inputType="textPassword"
        android:hint="Password"/>

    <Button
        android:id="@+id/button"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Login"/>
</LinearLayout>
```

Each ```View``` must have a defined width and height, however other values need not be specified.

While absolute values can be specified, such as the hint and text attributes in the example above, this is not recommended as it is more difficult to refactor and much more difficult to adapt to other languages and locales.

Instead attributes should be specified in the applications values directory.
The values directory is part of the resources directory, which also contains layout files and other resources such as images.
Hint text is specified in a file called strings.xml

``` XML
<resources>
        <string name="hint_login_username">Username</string>
</resources>
```

This value can then be referenced elsewhere as 

``` XML
<EditText
    android:id="@+id/user_name"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:ems="10"
    android:inputType="textPersonName"
    android:hint="@string/hint_login_username"/>
```

However the values are specified, the XML will then be used by the ```LayoutInflater``` class to create a tree of ```View``` objects with the specified attributes.

The attributes are passed as an ```AttributeSet``` object which is usually used to obtain a ```TypedArray``` which contains the resolved attributes.

When the layout above is inflated and set as the root layout in an ```Activity``` it will look like the image below

![Example layout](http://i.imgur.com/Sorbgys.png)

#page

#### Dimensions

The example above used ```match_parent``` and ```wrap_content``` to define the dimensions of each ```View```.
These values refer to constants which, as their names suggest, inform the system to layout the ```Views``` either to fill the available space within their parent ```ViewGroup``` or to the space requested by the instance of ```View```.

In order to properly layout a collection of ```Views```, actual sizes must be specified.

```Views``` can be specified as having a particular dimension in pixels with the px unit, which simply draws the ```View``` across the requested number of pixels.

The three units which directly relate to a physical dimension are as follows
 - in Inches based on the size of the screen
 - pt 72nds of an inch based on the physical size of the screen 
 - mm Millimetres based on the size of the screen

In practice, none of the four units above are particularly useful because device dimensions and resolutions vary greatly.

There are therefore sizes independent of the size and resolution of the device:

 - dp or dip are density independent pixels based on the physical density (dots per inch) of the screen. Density independent pixels are relative to a screen with a density of 160 dots per inch. This allows a ```View``` to maintain its proportions on different resolutions and form factors.
 - sp are scale independent pixels which are similar to dp, but are also scaled with the user's font size. This unit is recommended for use with text in order to respect both the device dimensions and the users preference.

#page

#### View binding

In order to interact with the ```View``` tree and provide a functional application, the application code must have access to the inflated ```View``` objects.
This is achieved by assigning ids to each view.
As shown in the the layout above, every view can have an id attribute. This is a string which must be unique to the current view tree. When the application is built, all of the attributes for each module in the application are collected into a single class named R, with subclasses for each of the resource types.

For a complete application the R class is usually thousands of lines

![Resources](http://imgur.com/DTSTWjv.png)

The id class contains the integer values of all the ids used throughout the app.

In our ```Activity``` we create member variables for the ```Views``` which we need to access.

``` Java
package com.tpb.example;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.widget.Button;
import android.widget.EditText;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private EditText mUserNameEditor;
    private EditText mPasswordEditor;
    private Button mLoginButton;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    }
}
```

After calling ```setContentView``` we can assign the inflated ```Views``` to these variables.

```
 setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
 mUserNameEditor = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.user_name);
 mPasswordEditor = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.password);
 mLoginButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button);
```

While this method is part of the Android SDK, and the default way to access the ```View``` tree, it is verbose and quickly becomes difficult to read when accessing complex layouts.
The most common solution to this problem is ButterKnife.

ButterKnife is an annotation processor which generates the necessary lookups from annotations at build time.

The same ```Activity``` class using ButterKnife is as follows

``` Java
@BindView(R.id.user_name) EditText mUserNameEditor;
@BindView(R.id.password) EditText mPasswordEditor;
@BindView(R.id.button) Button mLoginButton;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    ButterKnife.bind(this);
}
```

ButterKnife can also other resources 

```Java
@BindColor(R.color.colorPrimary) int primaryColor;
```

As well as assigning click listeners to ```Views``` 

```Java
@OnClick(R.id.button)
void onButtonClick() {
    //Do something
}
```

rather than 
``` Java
mLoginButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        //Do something
    }
});
```

#page

### Fragments

In all cases, at least one ```Activity``` must be used to display an application, however it is not always necessary, and often adds unnecessary complexity to use a full ```Activity``` for each component of the application.

A ```Fragment``` is 'a behaviour or a portion of user interface in ```Activity```'.
Multiple ```Fragments``` can be combined within an ```Activity``` to produce dynamic layouts on different devices, and allow easy reuse of components across different parts of an application.

A ```Fragment``` has its own lifecycle separate from its parent ```Activity```

![Fragment lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/images/fragment_lifecycle.png)

```Fragments``` are commonly used in ```ViewPagers``` to display multiple related sets of content within the same ```Activity```.

![enter image description here](http://imgur.com/GsPWoBA.png)

### RecyclerViews

The ```ListView``` class was added to Android in API level `.
As its name suggests a ```ListView``` is used to show a set of ```Views``` in a scrollable list.

The ```RecyclerView``` was added in API level 22 (February 2015) with the intention of replacing the ```ListView```.

The ```RecyclerView``` brought three key improvements over the ```ListView```

 1. In a ```RecyclerView``` ```Views``` are always reused as the user scrolls. When the ```RecyclerView``` is first drawn, it instantiates as many ```ViewHolder``` instances as are necessary to fill the screen and provide some padding before reusing these ```Views``` by binding the appropriate data to them rather than creating new instances. This reduces memory usage and stops unnecessary ```findViewById``` calls which are costly as they require traversing the ```View``` tree.
 2. Animations are decoupled from the individual ```Views``` and delegated to an ```ItemAnimator``` which provides default animations for common actions such as insertion and removal of items.
 3. The list itself is decoupled from its containing ```ViewGroup``` which allows much more complex  item layouts with ```LayoutManagers``` such as the ```StaggeredGridLayoutManager``` which can ```Views``` of different sizes as in Google Keep (Below).

 ![Google keep](http://imgur.com/WeVtSkc.png)

### Basic storage

While many applications use a variety of database solutions, it is not always necessary or the best solution to store simple values in a full database.

The ```SharedPreferences``` system is a persistent set of key value pairs which can be used to store application information such as settings.

Each 'preference' is a key value set stored under a particular name.
Once a ```SharedPreference``` object has been returned for the set, the key value pairs within the set can be read from and written to.


#page

### Build system

Android uses the Gradle build system.
Gradle converts each of the files in the project to the necessary type to be packaged in an application, as well as performing minification and obfuscation if told to.
Java files are converted to dex files, and XML files are built into the required resource classes.

Gradle is a plugin based system which makes it particularly useful for Android development which development which often contains multiple languages other than Java, such as C and C++ through the native development kit, as well as other Java Virtual Machine based languages such as Kotlin and Scala which can replace Java entirely and provide many useful features not present in versions of Java present on older devices.

A build script for a near empty project may appear as follows

``` gradle
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
    compileSdkVersion 25
    buildToolsVersion "25.0.2"
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.tpb.example"
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 25
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
        testInstrumentationRunner "android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
    androidTestCompile('com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:2.2.2', {
        exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'support-annotations'
    })
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.3.0'
    compile 'com.jakewharton:butterknife:8.5.1'
    annotationProcessor 'com.jakewharton:butterknife-compiler:8.5.1'
    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
}
```

This build script includes the Android support library, ButterKnife, and runners for the built in tests.
All applications have a debug build type, however this build script also specifies a release build type which would result in ProGuard being applied to obfuscate the source, and the test dependencies not being included.

More complicated scripts can also be included:
In order to determine when a bug was introduced, it is useful to have a different ```versionCode``` for each change made to the code.
If the Git version control system is being used, this can be achieved by checking the number of commits when the application is built.

This is done by executing a Git command to count the number of revisions.

``` gradle
def gitInfo() {
    def commitCount = 0
    def revision = "(unknown revision)"
    try {
        def stdout = new ByteArrayOutputStream()
        exec {
            commandLine 'git', 'rev-list', '--all', '--count'
            standardOutput stdout
        }
        commitCount = stdout.toString().trim().toInteger()
        stdout = new ByteArrayOutputStream()
        exec {
            commandLine 'git', 'rev-list', 'HEAD', '-n', '1'
            standardOutput stdout
        }
        revision = stdout.toString().trim()
    }
    catch (error) {
        println "Error: ${error}"
    }
    return [commitCount: commitCount, revision: revision]
}
```

The ```versionCode``` can then be written ```versionCode gitInfo().commitCount```.

The Android build system will generate an APK (Android Package Kit) which can be installed on a test device.

#### Debugging

Whether running their application on a physical device or an emulator, communication with the device is managed through ADB (Android Debugging Bridge).

Once a device has been connected via ADB the Logcat can be used for simple debugging.
The Logcat is used to print messages and exceptions and is usually used through the ```Log``` class.

The ```Log``` class provides 6 static methods for logging different levels of information.
Each method takes a ```TAG``` string which is used to identify the source of the log, and most methods have overloadings for logging strings as well as ```Throwable``` exceptions.

 - V (Verbose) The highest level of logging, generally used when debugging
 - I (Information) Used to report useful information, usually that an operation has completed successfully
 - D (Debug) Used for debugging purposes only, to track the flow of an application
 - W (Warning) Used to notify of unexpected behaviour
 - E (Error) Used to log an error which is known to have occurred. Often prints a stack trace.
 - WTF (What a terrible failure) Used to report an exception that should never happen.

## Identification of the problem

In July 2012, GitHub released an offical app for Android.

# TODO Split frames from GIF

![GitHub app](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/391331/6142496/22c87a64-b16c-11e4-8715-b1d8c1d78359.gif)


GitHub later dropped support for their app in favour of a mobile website with severely limited features.
GitHub's mobile website allows viewing most important information about a repository, as well as creating comments on issues and commits, however it has no editing functionality for content which has already been created.
Some areas, such as the projects section, are entirely missing from the mobile website.

The source of the original app has been used to continue support for a number of similar apps, however they have the same limitations as the original app as they are built on a 5 year old codebase.
Further, the maintainers of some of the most used GitHub apps have recently dropped their support.

### Users

According to GitHub's 2016 statistics there are 5.8 million active GitHub users with over 19.4 million repositories.

As GitHub is designed for groups of developers to collaborate it is reasonable to assume that GitHub's users would make use of a method for keeping track of their projects without having access to a computer.

### Proposition and objectives

I will develop a GitHub client for Android to implement the features of the GitHub website.

In order to be more useful than GitHub's mobile website, and other clients, an Android client must implement most of the functionality of the desktop website.


The client must implement the following features:

<ol type="1">
    <li> Sign in 
        <ol type="a"> 
            <li>Allow the user to log in to GitHub with their credentials </li>
            <li>Store the authentication token received from GitHub </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li> Users 
        <ol type="a"> 
            <li>Display available information about a user

### Limitations

#### Processing power

Unlike the GitHub website, which has the benefit of running on more powerful devices, an Android app must perform the same tasks on a considerably less powerful device, without causing any inconvenience to the user.

One of the key problems will be to ensure that the user interface remains responsive.
By default, all logic will be run on the UI thread, which is usually the only thread which is allowed to modify a view, as only the original thread that created a view hierarchy can touch its views.

In order to stop the UI thread from being blocked by other operations, such as networking or markdown rendering, worker threads should be used to perform the calculations and then call back to the main thread to perform the UI update.

#### Screen size

Due to the limited screen size, and vertical orientation of mobile devices, some content which has been designed to be viewed on much larger landscape oriented screens may not display properly.

While not ideal, some content such as code and repository READMEs can be displayed such that they can be scrolled in two axis, as shown on the GitHub mobile website below:

![Code on GitHub mobile website](http://imgur.com/oJaiBFT.png)

#### API

There are some limitations to the GitHub API.

##### Rate limiting

For non authenticated requests to the GitHub API there is a rate limit of 60 requests per hour.
For content which must be loaded individually, this limit can be easily exceeded.

Requests authenticated by a user sign in have a limit of 5000 requests per hour, an amount which a user is unlikely to exceed.

In order to ensure that users do not consistently hit rate limits, they must sign in rather than being able to use the app anonymously.

##### Lack of endpoints

While the GitHub API provides almost all of the data required to implement the proposed solution there are some features of the GitHub website which cannot be easily duplicated.

Firstly, there is no API endpoint to find a user's pinned repositories.
The client can still replicate this feature by pinning repositories within the app.

Secondly, the API endpoint for contributions works by repository, rather than by user.
One possibility might be to use the search API to find repositories that a user has contributed to, and load the contributions for each of them before calculating the total number of contributions made by the user.
This is an awful idea as it will fail completely if a single request fails, as well as being unacceptably slow due to the number of requests made.

Instead, the contributions image can be loaded with a single request

![Contributions](http://imgur.com/4zp8SG2.png)

As the contributions image is an SVG containing the contributions information, it can be easily parsed to calculate the number of contributions made per day.
        

#### Lack of push API

The GitHub API is purely restful, all data is requested by the client and returned in a JSON format.

As there is no method for GitHub to notify the client of new notifications, the client must repeatedly poll the API for any updates to the user's notifications.

In order to reduce data usage, and to ensure that the impact on rate limiting is reduced, conditional requests can be used.
This is done by passing date-time string under the 'If-Modified-Since' header.
If the data has not been modified, the API will return a 304 Not Modified code and the request will not count against the rate limit.

### Proposed design

As explained in the background section, an Android app is made up of Activities and Fragments.

In order to implement the functionality listed above the app requires multiple activities to mimic the pages on the GitHub website.

#### User information Activity

The initial Activity should display the same information that a user would see when they navigated to their own GitHub page.

![GitHub user page](http://imgur.com/Szvqa9c.png)

This page can be easily adapted to a mobile layout as it is already paginated.

The root activity layout only needs to contain the navigation interface.
This is the toolbar which displays back and settings navigation, and the viewpager layout which displays the different page names.

![App user activity](http://imgur.com/BPBgFFA.png)

Within the viewpager for this Activity, there will be 6 pages.

The first should display information about the user and their activity

![User info fragment](http://imgur.com/2G9uwEz.png)

The second should list the user's repositories

A single repository is shown as a list item with the repository name, description, stars and forks, and a button to pin the repository.

![Repository viewholder](http://imgur.com/FARbi35.png)

The third lists the user's starred repositories, using the same list item layout as the user's own repositories without the pin button.

The fourth lists the user's Gists

# Design

## Data structures and sources

Almost all of the data used in the application is acquired through the GitHub API

### Authentication

#### Basic authentication

Requests can be authenticated by sending the user's username and password in the request header, however this is not a an acceptable method of authentication for an Android client.

The first problem is that, while HTTPS requests are encrypted, the request itself is likely to be logged by the Android system, and may pass through another service if the user has a VPN active.

The second problem is that the user's account may require more than a password to authenticate.
GitHub supports two factor authentication.
If the user has activated two factor authentication, the two factor pin must be sent with each request.
This is not a usable experience as the pin changes each minute.

#### OAuth2 authentication

OAuth2 authentication allows applications to request authorization to a user's account without having access to their password.
This method also allows tokens to be limited to specific types of data, and can be revoked by the user.

In order to use the OAuth API, the application must be registered with GitHub.

![Application registration](http://imgur.com/EQu1SYh.png)

The application is registered with information recognisable to the user to ensure their trust when authorizing the application.
The callback URL is the URL which GitHub redirects to once the authorization is complete.

##### Web authentication flow

1. Redirect users to request access

Display the webpage ```https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize```

In order to successfully authenticate we must also pass parameters with the request.
The only required parameter is the client id which was received when the application was registered.

The scope parameter is used to specify what level of access is required to the user's account.

2. Redirect

If the user signs in and accepts the authorization request, GitHub redirects back to your site with a temporary parameter.

The ```code``` parameter has a limited timeframe to be exchanged for an authorization token.

This is done by posting to ```https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token```.

The post request must have three parameters:

1. The client id, which must match that provided when loading the authorization page
2. The client secret
3. The code received in 

If the request is successful the response will be a string containing the access token in the form:

``access_token=some_base_64_string&scope=the_scope_requested_in_step_1``.

3. Once the access token has been received it can be used for authorization by including the authorization header with each request.



##### Implementation of the authorization flow

In order to avoid duplication of values used throughout the GitHub API, I have used a single abstract class to contain the headers and path keys used throughout the project

#import "gitapi/src/main/java/com/tpb/github/data/APIHandler.java"

The ```APIHandler``` class is mostly static constants:

- GIT_BASE - The base URL for all GitHub API requests
- ACCEPT_HEADER_KEY - The key for the content type header
- ACCEPT_HEADER - The default content type, for JSON results
- ORGANIZATIONS_PREVIEW_ACCEPT_HEADER - A content type header required for some features of the API, specifically requesting collaborators on a repository
- PROJECTS_PREVIEW_API_HEADER - A content type header required for requesting information related to projects
- REPO_LICENSE_PREVIEW_API_HEADER - A content type header required to load information about a repositories license when loading the repository
- PAGES_PREVIEW_ACCEPT_HEADER - A content type header required to load information about a repositories pages when loading the repository
- AUTHORIZATION_HEADER_KEY - A header key for providing the authorization token
- AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN_FORMAT - A format string used when inserting the authorization key into a header

Next we have the headers themselves. 
Asheaders are key value pairs, they are represented as string to string maps.

We then have the ```SEGMENT_``` constants. These are segments of the API paths which are used across numerous different API requests.

The ```APIHandler``` constructor checks if the single instance of ```GitHubSession``` is null, and if so access the singleton session instance before initialising the headers.
Next each header map is initialised with the authorization token header, and their own respective accept headers.


The class which actually stores the authorization information is ```GitHubSession```, which was used once above in ```APIHandler```.

#import "gitapi/src/main/java/com/tpb/github/data/auth/GitHubSession.java"

```GitHubSession``` is a singleton class which saves and loads the user credentials and authorization token to and from shared preferences.

The private constructor is used to initialise the SharedPreferences instance, this either opens the pre-existing map or creates a new one if it does not exist.

When the user authorizes the app the access token is stored with  ```storeAccessToken(@NonNull String accessToken)```.

Once we have an authorization token, we can load the user's data and store it for later use.

The ```LoginActivity``` consists of two layouts, only one of which is visible at a time. 
 
The first layout is a ```WebView``` which is used to display the user authentication page, and the second is a layout to display the user's information once they have signed in.

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/login/LoginActivity.java"

The ```LoginActivity``` binds four views.

1. The ```WebView``` which displays the login webpage
2. The ```CardView``` which olds the ```WebView``` and user layout
3. The spinning ```ProgressBar``` which is display to indicate progress while the ```WebView``` is loading or the user's information is being loaded.
4. The ```LinearLayout``` which will be filled with views showing the user's information


In the ```onCreate``` method the ```WebView``` is set up not to allow scrolling, to enable JavaScript, and to use a client implementation to override page loading.

``` java
mWebView.setVerticalScrollBarEnabled(false);
mWebView.setHorizontalScrollBarEnabled(false);
mWebView.setWebViewClient(new OAuthWebViewClient(OAuthHandler.getListener()));
mWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
mWebView.loadUrl(OAuthHandler.getAuthUrl());
mWebView.setLayoutParams(FILL);
```

The ```OAuthWebViewClient``` extends ```WebViewClient``` and is used to capture the code once the user has logged in, as well as ensuring that the user only navigates through the pages required to log in.

The method ```onPageStarted(WebView view, String url, Bitmap favicon)``` is called whenever a page load begins.
The client checks if the url contains `?code=', and if so,  passes the segment after that point to the ```OAuthHandler''' which then requests the authorization token.

This completes objective 1.a

#import "gitapi/src/main/java/com/tpb/github/data/auth/OAuthHandler.java"

The ```OAuthHandler``` is used to load the authenticated user for the first time.

```getAccessToken(final String code)``` performs a get request to the formatted token url, and parses the response as a string.
The access token is extracted from the string between "access_token=" and "&scope".
Once the access token has been extracted:
- The token is stored with ```GitHubSession```
- The headers are initialised with the token
- The authentication listener (```LoginActivity```) is notified, allowing it to update the ```ProgressBar```
- ```fetchUser()``` is called to load the authenticated user model

```fetchUser()``` performs another request, this to time /user, which loads the authenticated user if provided with an authorization token.
The response is returned as a ```JSONObject```, Java's built in JSON model, and is passed to ```GitHubSession``` where it is stored as a string for later use, and parsed into a ```User``` object.
The authentication listener is then called again, with the ```User``` object.


Prior to the ```WebView``` loading the login page, the ```LoginActivity``` shows the view with a spinning ```ProgressBar```, and once it has finished the login page is displayed

| --- | --- | 
|![Login Activity loading webpage](http://imgur.com/Iv6xAz7.png) | ![Login Activity login page](http://imgur.com/x2MKOxk.png) |

Once the user has logged in, the GitHub authentication page will show the access which the app is asking for, and ask the user to grant access:

|  |  | 
| --- | --- | 
|![Page 1](http://imgur.com/zmbcpfA.png) | ![Page 2](http://imgur.com/wiieru1.png)

If the user presses the authorize button, the page will be redirected through url containing the path parameter "code".

In on the overriden ```onPageStarted``` method of the ```OAuthWebViewClient``` this results in the ```code``` parameter being passed to the ```OAuthHandler``` through ```fetchAccessToken```.

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/login/LoginActivity.java $public void onPageStarted(WebView view, String url, Bitmap favicon)$"


#import "gitapi/src/main/java/com/tpb/github/data/auth/OAuthHandler.java $void fetchAccessToken$"

The ```fetchAccessToken``` method performs a get request to the token URL created with the apps client id and secret, adding the code as a path parameter.

On a successful response the access token is split from the returned value and stored through ```GitHubSession```.

This completes objective 1.b

The authorization headers are initialised with a call to ```initHeaders``` and the ```OAuthAuthenticationListener``` (```LoginActivity```) is notified of the success.

Finally, ```fetchUser``` is called.

This method performs a second get request to the Git API,  this time to load the ```User``` model and store the JSON data, as well as notifying the ```OAuthAuthenticationListener``` that the user has been loaded, allowing the user information to be displayed.

### Data models and loading

All of the models from the GitHub API are returned as JSON unless another content type is specified.
Each endpoint returns either a single model, or a single dimensional array of models.

All models used extend the abstract class ```DataModel``` which contains some of the commonly used keys, as well as the object creation date which is used across all models.

#import "gitapi/src/main/java/com/tpb/github/data/models/DataModel.java"

Networking is split into two classes extending ```APIHandler``` is split across four classes.

#### Loader

The ```Loader``` class is responsible for almost all get requests sent to the GitHub API.

Each method is responsible for load a single model type, and takes the path or filter parameters required to load the model(s) as well as an implementation of a generic loader.

The first interface ```ItemLoader``` is used when loading a single model or value.

``` Java
public interface ItemLoader<T> {

    void loadComplete(T data);

    void loadError(APIError error);

}
```

Any class implementing ```ItemLoader``` must implement ```loadComplete(T data)``` as well as ```loadError(APIError error)```.

Most uses of ```ItemLoader``` load an instance of ```DataModel```.

An example is ```loadIssue(@NonNull final ItemLoader<Issue> loader, String repoFullName, int issueNumber, boolean highPriority)```


#import "gitapi/src/main/java/com/tpb/github/data/Loader.java $loadIssue(@NonNull final ItemLoader<Issue> loader, String repoFullName$"


this method is used to load a single ```Issue``` model given a full repository name (user login and repository name) and the issue number.

Some single methods also have prefetching when a null ```ItemLoader``` is passed to them:

#import "gitapi/src/main/java/com/tpb/github/data/Loader.java $loadProject(@Nullable final ItemLoader<Project> loader, int id)$"

In this case the ```ANRequest``` instance is built and only requested as a ```JSONObject``` when there is an ```ItemLoader``` to deal with the model.
This allows the response to be preloaded before an Activity is started, and only parsed to a ```DataModel``` once a user interface is present to use it.


The ```Loader``` class also contains the ```ListLoader``` interface

```Java
public interface ListLoader<T> {

    void listLoadComplete(List<T> data);

    void listLoadError(APIError error);

}
```

which is used to return objects parsed from a JSONArray as a list of ```DataModels```.

#### Models

Numerous different models are required to fulfill different objectives

    <li> User model:
        <ul>

      </li>
     <li> Notification model:
        <ul> 8. Notifications</ul>
     </li>
</ol>

## Base structure

In order to maintain a cleaner application structure, it is normal to separate repeated logic into a base class or a set of utility classes.

### BaseActivity

In this case ```BaseActivity``` is used to check that there is an authentication token stored, to provide an onClick method for the toolbar back button, cancel network requests,  and to fix a memory leak caused by Android system transitions keeping a reference to the ```DecorView``` which in turn references the ```Activity```.

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/common/BaseActivity.java"

#### onCreate

The ```BaseActivity``` ```onCreate``` method checks that ```GitHubSession``` has an access token, setting the ```mHasAccess``` flag accordingly.

If there is an access token, the notification service (Objective 8) is started.

If there is not an access token the ```mHasAccess``` flag is set to false, allowing any extending ```Activities``` to return from their ```onCreate``` methods without performing any unnecessary initialisation, such as ```View``` inflation.

An ```Intent``` is then created to launch ```LoginActivity```, setting the flags ```Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK``` and ```Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK``` which result in the current task, a group of ```Activities``` being destroyed and a new task being created for the ```LoginActivity```.

Next, the method checks if the ```Intent``` which started ```BaseActivity``` is not from the home screen (```ACTION_MAIN```).
If the ```Intent``` is not from the homescreen, the ```Activity``` was launched from a URL which the user likely wants to view once they have signed in. This can be achieved by passing the launch ```Intent``` forward to the ```LoginActivity```.

#### onDestroy

##### Network cancelling

Each network request made uses the calling object, e.g. an implementation of ```ItemLoader``` as a tag.
The ```BaseActivity``` retains a ```WeakReferences``` to each of the ```Fragments``` attached to it, and uses these to cancel network requests as they ```Activity``` is destroyed.

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/common/BaseActivity.java $void onAttachFragment$"

```onAttachFragment``` adds a ```WeakReference``` to the ```Fragment``` to ```mWeakFragments```, and ```cancelNetworkRequests``` uses these to cancel network requests started by each ```Fragment```.

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/common/BaseActivity.java $cancelNetworkRequests$"

##### Memory Leak

A bug introduced in Android 5.0, launched in November 2014, which results in a reference to the ```Activity``` being kept in the ```TransitionManager```.
The memory leak can be solved by using reflection to remove the ```Activity``` from the ```TransitionManager``` map.

```
final ThreadLocal<WeakReference<ArrayMap<ViewGroup, ArrayList<Transition>>>> runningTransitions = (ThreadLocal<WeakReference<ArrayMap<ViewGroup, ArrayList<Transition>>>> runningTransitionsField.get(transitionManagerClass);
```

The ```runningTransitionsField``` refers to a ```ThreadLocal``` ```WeakReference``` to a map of ```ViewGroups``` to ```ArrayLists``` of ```Transitions```.

```ThreadLocal``` is a reference to a field, such that each ```Thread``` which access a thread-local variable via the ```TheadLocals``` get and set methods have their own copy of the variable.

A ```WeakReference``` is a reference which is not strong enough to prevent grabage collection.

Finally we have the map which may contain the reference to our ```Activity```'s ```DecorView```.

```removeActivityFromTransitionManager``` checks that both the ```ThreadLocal```'s ```WeakReference``` is not null, and that the ```WeakReference```'s ```ArrayMap``` is not null before checking the ```ArrayMap``` for the ```DecorView``` and removing it if is present.

#### onToolbarBackPressed

```onToolbarBackPressed``` is used solely to reduce clutter in other ```Activity``` classes.
When a ```View``` is declared in XML, its onClick listener can be set with the ```onClick``` attribute.
Rather than adding this method in all of the ```Activities```, it can be added to ```BaseActivity```.

``` XML
<ImageButton
    android:id="@+id/back_button"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:background="@android:color/transparent"
    android:src="@drawable/ic_arrow_back"
    android:onClick="onToolbarBackPressed"/>
```

The back button shown in each ```Toolbar``` then references this method, which calls the ```Activity``` method ```onBackPressed``` to perform the same behaviour as pressing the navigation back key.

#page

### NetworkImageView

The ```NetworkImageView``` is a subclass of ```ImageView``` used to asynchronously load images from a given URL and display them once they have finished downloading.

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/common/NetworkImageView.java"

The ```NetworkImageView``` has three instance variables; the URL to be loaded as well as two resource identifiers for the loading and error states.

When the ```NetworkImageView``` is instantiated it checks the ```AttributeSet``` for resource identifiers set in XML.

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/common/NetworkImageView.java $void init$"

The ```loadImage``` method is responsible for loading and displaying the image.

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/common/NetworkImageView.java $void loadImage$"

The first check performed in ```loadImage``` is whether the image can actually be drawn.

The ```View``` width and height are collected, before the ```LayoutParams``` are checked to determine whether the ```NetworkImageView``` is of a fixed size, or should expand to the size of its image.
If the ```NetworkImageView``` has 0 width and height, and doesn't wrap in either direction, then ```loadImage``` returns as it cannnot display the image.

The second check is whether the URL is empty.
If a null or empty url is passed, any current request is cancelled, and the default image is set.

The third check is whether the URL which is currently being loaded, or has been loaded is the same as the URL passed to the ```NetworkImageView```.
If the URL is already being loaded, ```loadImage``` returns, otherwise it cancels the current request in preparation for loading a new image.

Finally, the maximum width and height of the ```NetworkImageView``` are determined and the image is loaded.

The ```onResponse``` callback has two arguments, the response, and the isImmediate flag which indicates whether the response was returned form cache.

If both isImmediate and isInLayoutPass are true, the ```NetworkImageView``` has not yet been properly drawn an the image cannot yet be displayed.
In this case, a ```post``` call is made, which will add a runnable to the UI thread ```MessageQueue``` for execution once all other work on the UI thread is complete.

When the ```NetworkImageView``` is able to set the image, it checks whether the ```Bitmap``` is non null, and sets either the ```Bitmap``` or the default resource accordingly.

#page

### ViewSafeFragment

The lifecycle of a ```Fragment``` is different than that of an ```Activity```.

The first method called is ```onAttach``` when the ```Fragment``` is attached to an ```Activity```.
Next, ```onCreate``` is called, which might be used to initialise non view-dependent logic.
Most importantly, ```onCreateView``` is called.

```onCreateView``` returns a ```View``` object and must created the layout for the ```Fragment```.

As the ```Activity``` is created prior to the ```Fragment``` ```View```s being created, the ```Fragment``` may have data to bind before it has to ```Views``` to bind them to.

In order to ensure that the ```Fragment``` doesn't attempt to bind data to a null ```View```, the ```Fragment``` has flag set when the its ```Views``` are created, and set back when its ```Views``` are destroyed.

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/common/ViewSafeFragment.java" 

In a concrete instance of ```ViewSafeFragment``` the mAreViewsValid flag should be set after inflation in ```onCreateView``` and used to check ```View``` validity before performing any binding.

#page

### Utility methods

The ```Util``` class contains numerous utility methods for formatting and finding array indices.

The ```indexOf``` methods are used to find the index of a value within an array of integers, strings, pairs, or a generic type.
Each method performs a linear search for the key item, returning -1 if it does not exist.

The  ```formatBytes``` and ```formatKB``` methods are used to format a number of bytes or kilobytes into a 2 decimal place string representation of the highest unit suffix.

The next method, ```formatDateLocally``` is used to format a date in the expected manner for the device locale.

```isNotNullOrEmpty``` is used to check that a string is not null, not empty, and not a "null" string returned from a ```JSONObject```.

Finally, the ```insertString``` methods are used to insert a string at the currently selected position in an ```EditText```, before moving the cursor to the end of the inserted string, or to a provided offset.


## User Activity

Once a user has logged in, their account can be displayed.
This is objective 2.

The immediate sub-objectives of objective 2 are written to represent the different components shown when displaying a user in a paged ```Activity``` as described in the proposed design.

Each section will be shown as a ```Fragment``` within a ```ViewPager```.
This makes the ```UserActivity``` layout and class simple, as most logic is kept separate, with each ```Fragment``` only concerned with its own purpose.

#import "app/src/main/res/layout/activity_user.xml"

The ```UserActivity``` layout contains an ```AppBarLayout``` allowing the ```Toolbar``` to scroll with the contents of any ```ScrollViews``` within the ```Fragments``` which are contained in the ```ViewPager```.

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/user/UserActivity.java"

#import "app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_user_info.xml"

When it is created, ```UserActivity``` calls the ```super``` method (```BaseActivity```) which performs the access check, allowing ```UserActivity``` to return if the app doesn't have an access token.
If this check passes, ```onCreate``` method continues by checking the theme theme before inflating the ```activity_user``` layout and bindings its ```Views```. 

Once the ```Views``` have been inflated, the ```UserActivity``` can continue by creating the ```FragmentPagerAdapter``` which is responsible for creating each of the ```Fragments```.

The ```UserActivity``` then determines whether it has been started from a link to a user, in which case the ```User``` must be loaded, or if the app is starting from the homescreen to display the authenticated user.

## UserFragment

```UserFragment``` is an abstract class extending ```ViewSafeFragment``` used to add a ```User``` model instance, the ```userLoaded``` method , as well as to save and restore the ```User``` instance when the ```Fragment``` is added to or removed from the back stack.

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/user/fragments/UserFragment.java"

### UserInfoFragment

The first ```Fragment``` to be displayed is the ```UserInfoFragment```.
The ```UserInfoFragment``` is to fulfill objective 2.i, displaying information about the user.

The ```UserInfoFragment``` layout has two cards, the first displaying text based information about the user, and the second displaying a graph of the users' contributions.

#import "app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_user_info.xml"

The layout included within the first ```CardView``` is the same layout used in ```LoginActivity``` to display the user's information

#import "app/src/main/res/layout/shard_user_info.xml"

and contains a ```LinearLayout``` to display the user's avatar and username, as well as another ```LinearLayout``` to display a list of the user's available information.

Once inflated and bound with a ```User```'s information, the layout will be displayed as below.

![UserInfoFragment](http://imgur.com/N7QriPz.png)

#### Animation

In Android 5.0, released November 2014, shared element transitions were introduced.

These transitions allow a ```View``` to be shared between two ```Activities``` via the ```ViewOverlay``` which is drawn on top of all other ```Views```.
A common use if for an ```ImageView``` to animate between two ```Activities```. This works well so long as the ```ImageView``` maintains its aspect ratio.

A common case for the ```UserActivity``` being opened is when the user clicks on an avatar. The avatar can be animated from its original position to its new position in the ```UserActivity```. The user name can also be animated from one ```TextView``` to another.

If the ```Activity``` had a single layout inflated in its ```onCreate``` method, this animation would be simple to perform, and wouldn't require any Java code only XML attributes.
However, the ```NetworkImageView``` displaying the ```User``` avatar is shown in the ```UserInfoFragment``` which is inflated after the ```UserActivity```. Further, the image stored in 
the ```NetworkImageView``` in the launching ```Activity``` was loaded from a URL, and the new ```NetworkImageView``` in the ```UserInfoFragment``` would load the image again, defeating 
the purpose of the transition.

The first problem is solved by postponing the entry transition.
The line after ```View``` binding in ```UserActivity``` is the call ```postponeEnterTransition()``` which, as its name suggests, postpones the entry transition until the 
```startPostponedEnterTransition``` is called.

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/user/fragments/UserInfoFragment.java $View onCreateView$"

Once the ```View``` has been created in ```UserInfoFragment``` we have the ```NetworkImageView``` required to perform the transition.
However, the full layout has not been calculated, so the animation cannot yet be performed.

In order to wait until the layout has been completed, an ```OnPreDrawListener``` is added to the ```ViewTreeObserver``` of the ```NetworkImageView``` mAvatar.

When  ```onPreDraw``` is called, the listener checks that the the ```Intent``` contains the key ```intent_drawable```, and if it is present it sets the ```Bitmap``` of mAvatar 
as well as setting the text of the ```TextView``` mUserLogin.

Due to the nature of ```View``` layouts and drawing, adding a listener to the ```ViewTreeObserver``` is computationally expensive. It is therefore important to remove the 
```onPreDrawListener``` from the ```NetworkImageView```.

Finally, ```startPostponedEnterTransition``` can be called on the ```UserInfoFragment```'s parent ```Activity```.

The second problem, which was assumed to have been solved when setting the drawable above, is to provide the ```ImageView``` in the new ```Activity``` with the avatar to be drawn.
This is done in the ```UI``` utility method ```setDrawableForIntent```

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/util/UI.java $static void setDrawable$"

The method checks that the ```ImageView```'s ```Drawable``` is an instance of ```BitmapDrawable```, which it will be if loaded from a ```Bitmap``` as ```NetworkImageView``` does.
The ```instanceof``` comparator also performs a null check as the language specification defines the result of the operator to be "true if the value of the RelationalExpression is not null and the reference could be cast (§15.16) to the ReferenceType without raising a ClassCastException".

If the ```BitmapDrawable``` is valid, it is added to the ```Intent```.

#### Use of ViewSafeFragment

When a ```UserFragment``` is created, there are two possible orders of events.

The first is that ```onCreateView``` is called, and at some point in the future the network call to load the ```User``` returns, ```userLoaded``` is called and the ```Views``` are bound.
The second is that the ```userLoaded``` is called before ```onCreateView```, which would result in a ```NullPointerException``` if an attempt was made to  bind data to null ```Views```.

This is solved with two checks.

In ```userLoaded``` the first line is ```mUser = user```, assigning the member variable ```mUser```.
The second line is ```if(!mAreViewsValid) return``` which will ensure that no ```Views``` are bound to if they have not yet been created. This deals with the crash which could happen in
the second case, however we must now ensure that the ```Views``` are bound once they have been created.

This is achieved with the second check, the last line in ```onCreateView``` before returning the ```View```.
This check is ```if(mUser != null) userLoaded(mUser)```. As mAreViewsValid has been set to true, this will bind the ```Views``` if the ```User``` was initially loaded before the ```Views``` were created.
This structure is used throughout the different concrete implementations of ```UserFragment```.

#### ContributionsView

Objective 2.i.d is to display the user's contributions in a graphical form.

As explained in the limitations section, there is no API for loading a user's contributions. Instead this can be achieved by parsing the SVG image of a user's contributions

![Contributions](http://imgur.com/4zp8SG2.png)

This image can be loaded from https://github.com/users/user_name/contributions

##### Loading contributions

Each column in the image is made up of a set of rectangles, with three important attributes.

```XML
<g transform="translate(0, 0)">
          <rect class="day" width="10" height="10" x="13" y="0" fill="#ebedf0" data-count="0" data-date="2016-04-10"></rect>
          <rect class="day" width="10" height="10" x="13" y="12" fill="#ebedf0" data-count="0" data-date="2016-04-11"></rect>
          <rect class="day" width="10" height="10" x="13" y="24" fill="#ebedf0" data-count="0" data-date="2016-04-12"></rect>
          <rect class="day" width="10" height="10" x="13" y="36" fill="#ebedf0" data-count="0" data-date="2016-04-13"></rect>
          <rect class="day" width="10" height="10" x="13" y="48" fill="#ebedf0" data-count="0" data-date="2016-04-14"></rect>
          <rect class="day" width="10" height="10" x="13" y="60" fill="#ebedf0" data-count="0" data-date="2016-04-15"></rect>
          <rect class="day" width="10" height="10" x="13" y="72" fill="#ebedf0" data-count="0" data-date="2016-04-16"></rect>
      </g>
```

Firstly, the ```fill``` attribute provides the hexadecimal colour code used to draw the rectangle, which can be parsed and used to draw the image later.
Secondly, the ```data-count``` attribute provides the number of contributions made for the particular day.
Finally, the ```data-date``` attribute is the date represented by the rectangle in the format yyyy-mm-dd.

In order to load the SVG, a request can be made to download it as a string.

The ```ContributionsLoader``` class is used to load a user's contributions.

#import "contributionsview/src/main/java/com/tpb/contributionsview/ContributionsLoader.java"

The interface ```ContributionsRequestListener``` is used as a callback once the contributions information is loaded.
As such, the ```ContributionsLoader``` constructor takes a ```ContributionsLoader``` and stores a ```WeakReference``` to it.

The ```beginRequest``` method formats the user login and performs a get request to the URL of the SVG image.
If the image is loaded successfully, the ```parse``` method is called.

```parse``` uses two counters, ```first``` and ```last``` to iterate through each substring which is surrounded by the tags ```<rect``` and the closing tag ```/>```.
The ```String``` ```indexOf``` method searches a string for a substring from a given position, 0 in the simpler overloaded method, returning -1 if the substring is not present.

Each time the substring is found, the ```parse``` method adds a new ```ContributionsDay``` object to the contributions ```ArrayList```.

```ContributionsDay``` contains the integer value of the ```fill``` attribute, the long value of the ```data-date``` attribute, and the integer value of the ```data-count``` attribute.

Finally, if the ```ContributionsRequestListener``` is non null, the values are returned to it.

##### Displaying contributions

The ```ContributionsView``` is a descendant of ```View``` used to draw the contributions heatmap.

#import "contributionsview/src/main/java/com/tpb/contributionsview/ContributionsView.java"

The ```ContributionsView``` has attributes for its background colour, text colour, text size, and whether months should be displayed. A default user login can also be set via XML.

As the ```View``` is being repeatedly drawn, it is important to ensure that as few objects as possible are allocated in the ```onDraw``` method.
The single ```Paint``` objects for text and day (rectangle) painting are therefore re-used, as are the ```Rectangle``` used to store the ```View``` dimensions and the second ```Rectangle``` used to store text bounds.
The ```Calendar``` used for parsing dates is static and used in all instances of ```ContributionsView```.

The ```ContributionsView``` implements ```ContributionsRequestListener``` and contains the ```loadContributions``` method, which creates an anonymous ```ContributionsLoader``` and
begins loading the contributions for the given user.
In the ```onResponse``` method the ```ContributionsView``` stores the ```ArrayList``` of contributions and calls the ```invalidate``` method, forcing a redraw.
It also checks if its listener has been set, and notifies it of the newly loaded ```ArrayList``` of ```ContributionsDay``` objects.

The ```onDraw``` method needs to deal with two states, either the ```ContributionsView``` has a non empty list of ```ContributionsDays``` or it does not.

#import "contributionsview/src/main/java/com/tpb/contributionsview/ContributionsView.java $void onDraw$"

The ```onDraw``` method begins by measuring the size which it has to draw in.
Next, the number of columns to show horizontally can be calculated, as either the number of contributions split across 7 day weeks, or 52 weeks.

Each rectangle has an area of the view width over the horizontal number of contributions, however it must also account for the margin between each rectangle.
For each rectangular segment of the canvas, 90% of the width will be filled with the block, and the remaining 10% left as a margin.

Next the month text height is set as either the text size, or 0 depenedent on whether month text should be drawn.

The first draw call is to draw the background behind the image. This call draws the background colour behind everything but the space for the month text.

The next draw call is dependent on whether there are contributions to be drawn.
The contributions are drawn based on the day of the week, which is calculated from the value stored in each ```ContributionsDay``` and the ```Calendar```.
The y position is the day of the week multiplied by the total height of a rectangle plus the margin for drawing the month text.

After computing the initial y position, the ```onDraw``` method uses a for-each loop to iterate through each ```ContributionsDay```, setting the colour of mDayPainter, drawing the rectangle, and calculating the day of the week.
If the day of the week is 6, the week has ended; the x position is incremented by the width of rectangle and the y value is reset to the month text margin.
Otherwise, the y value is incremented by the height of a rectangle.

If there are no contributions to draw mDayPainter is set to the default background colour, and 364 rectangles are drawn to fill the 52 weeks with full 7 day weeks.

The final set of draw calls occur if mShouldDisplayMonths is true.
In this case mTextPainter is setup with mTextColor and the month text height, and the calendar is initialised to the current time, before subtracting 12 months to return to the start
of the year.
For each month in the year, the three letter month string is collected from the ```Calendar``` instance and the mTextBounds rectangle is used to store the measured bounds of the text,
ensuring that it doesn't extend past the end of the ```Canvas```.
After each draw call the ```Calendar``` month is incremented, and the x position is incremented by one twelfth of the ```Canvas``` width.

The final call in ```onDraw``` is to set the ```LayoutParams``` of the ```ContributionsView``` to ensure that the ```Canvas``` is drawn across the full width available.

##### Contributions statistics

Returning to the ```UserInfoFragment``` we have the callback for ```contributionsLoaded```.
This method computes numerous statistics about the user:
- Their total number of contributions
- Their average number of contributions per day
- Their average number of contributions per active day
- Their greatest number of contributions per day
- Their longest uninterrupted 'streak' of active days

#import "app/src/main/java/com/tpb/projects/user/fragments/UserInfoFragment.java $void contributionsLoaded$"

5 counters are used for the computation.
Each iteration of the loop checks if any contributions have been made.
If any contributions have been made, the total number of contributions is incremented by the value, the number of active days is incremented, the number of contributions on that day
is checked against the current maximum number of contributions, and streak counter is incremented before being checked against the current maxStreak value.
If no contributions have been made, the streak counter is reset to 0.

Once the computations have been made, the total number of contributions is made.
If it is 0, the "No contributions" string resource is displayed.
Otherwise, a string is built from 5 different format strings to display the information.

Before setting the text of mContributionsInfo, a check is performed to see if it already contains any text.
If the ```TextView``` is empty, then it will have 0 height (other than its margin), and setting its text would cause both it and its parent ```CardView``` to jump in size.
Rather than allowing this, an ```ObjectAnimator``` is used to increment the maxLines count of the ```TextView``` from 0 to the required number over a period of 200 milliseconds.
